## Voice and Tone Guidelines

### Brand Voice Characteristics

#### Professional but Approachable

- ✅ **Do**: "Your analysis is ready to review"
- ❌ **Don't**: "OMG, check out these amazing insights!"

#### Confident without Being Arrogant

- ✅ **Do**: "Based on 127 data points, we recommend..."
- ❌ **Don't**: "Obviously, you should..."

#### Helpful without Being Condescending

- ✅ **Do**: "Upload your account list to get started"
- ❌ **Don't**: "Simply upload your account list (it's that easy!)"

#### Transparent about Limitations

- ✅ **Do**: "This analysis is 73% confident based on available data"
- ❌ **Don't**: "This analysis is definitely correct"

### Writing Guidelines

#### Interface Copy

- **Button Labels**: Use action verbs ("Analyze Accounts", not "Click to Analyze")
- **Error Messages**: Be specific and actionable ("Upload failed: File must be CSV format")
- **Success Messages**: Brief and reassuring ("Account analysis completed successfully")
- **Loading States**: Set expectations ("Analyzing 1,247 accounts... This may take 2-3 minutes")

#### Technical Communication

- **Jargon**: Minimize but don't eliminate (users are technical professionals)
- **Explanations**: Provide context for AI confidence scores and methodologies
- **Data Sources**: Always attribute insights to specific data sources
- **Progress Updates**: Give meaningful status updates, not just "Loading..."

### Content Don'ts

- ❌ Don't use exclamation points in interface copy (unprofessional)
- ❌ Don't personify the system ("I found 23 insights for you")
- ❌ Don't use marketing language in functional interfaces
- ❌ Don't hide system limitations or data quality issues
